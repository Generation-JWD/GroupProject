## Task 6: Adding Tasks Programmatically
For this task, we'll be writing the code to add each task into an array using our Task Manager class.

## Task 7: Display The Tasks

For this task, we'll write the code to update a task's status to "Done" once a "Done" button on the task is clicked.

## Task 9: Persisting Tasks to LocalStorage
For this task, we'll persist (ie: save) our tasks to LocalStorage, so that we can load them again the next time we visit our page.

## Task 10: Deleting Tasks
Now that we are persisting tasks to localStorage, we need a way to delete old tasks so that they don't fill up the list over time.
